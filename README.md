    content: counter(line);

}
```

## Examples

### Basic Example

This example demonstrates a simple usage of the line numbers component with a code block.

```html
<div class="line-numbers">
    <pre>
        // Sample code
        function add(a, b) {
            return a + b;
        }
    </pre>
</div>
```

### Advanced Example

In this advanced example, we will use the component alongside a styled HTML table.

```html
<div class="line-numbers">
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Item</th>
                <th>Quantity</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Apples</td>
                <td>5</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Oranges</td>
                <td>10</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
